! WORK IN PROGRESS !

I reference additional publications in my other works:

- [Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/chauvinSimon/Hierarchical-Decision-Making-for-Autonomous-Driving)
- [Educational application of Hidden Markov Model to Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/chauvinSimon/hmm_for_autonomous_driving)
- [My 10 takeaways from the 2019 Intelligent Vehicle Symposium](https://github.com/chauvinSimon/IV19)

## Behavior Cloning, End-To-End (E2E), Imitation Learning

Codevilla, F., Santana, E., Antonio, M. L., & Gaidon, A. [2019].
**"Exploring the Limitations of Behavior Cloning for Autonomous Driving"**
[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08980)]

- Some related concepts:
  - `distributional shift problem`, `off-policy data collection`, [`CARLA`](http://carla.org/), `conditional imitation learning`, `residual architecture`, `reproducibility issue`, `variance caused by initialization and sampling`.
- One term: **“CILRS”** = **Conditional Imitation Learning** extended with a **ResNet** architecture and **Speed prediction**.
- One Q&A: _How to include in E2E learning information about the destination, i.e. to disambiguate imitation around multiple types of intersections?_
  - Add an high-level `navigational command` (e.g. _take the next right_, _left_, or _stay in lane_) to the tuple <`observation`, `expert action`> when building the dataset.
- One idea: learn to predict the ego speed ([`mediated perception`](http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/paper.pdf)) to address the _inertia problem_ stemming from [**causal confusion**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11979.pdf) (**biased correlation** between _low speed_ and _no acceleration_ - when the ego vehicle is stopped, e.g. at a red traffic light, the probability it stays static is indeed overwhelming in the training data).
- Another idea: The off-policy (expert) driving demonstration is not produced by an human, but rather generated from an **omniscient "AI" agent**.
- One quote:

> "The more common the vehicle model and color, the better the trained agent reacts to it. This raises ethical challenges in automated driving".

## Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Inverse Optimal Control

Kuderer, M., Gulati, S., & Burgard, W. [2015].
**"Learning driving styles for autonomous vehicles from demonstration"**
[[pdf](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/papers/kuderer15icra.pdf)]

- Some related concepts:
  - `inverse optimal control`, `IRL`,
- One term: **"ME-IRL"** = **Maximum Entropy** IRL. The probability distribution over trajectories is in the form `exp`(`-cost[f(traj), θ]`), to model that **agents are exponentially more likely to select trajectories with lower cost**.
- One Q&A: The trajectory object is first mapped to some feature vector (`speed`, `acceleration` ...). How to then derive a cost (or reward) from these features?
  - The author assume the cost function to be a **linear combination of the features**. The goal is then to **learn the weights**. But they acknowledge in the conclusion that it may be a too simple model. Maybe **neural nets** could help to capture some more complex relations.
- One quote about about the _maximum likelihood approximation_ in ME-IRL:

> "We assume that the demonstrations are in fact generated by minimizing a cost function (IOC), in contrast to the assumption that demonstrations are samples from a probability distribution (IRL)".
